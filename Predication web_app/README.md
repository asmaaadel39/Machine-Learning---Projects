🚀 Just built and deployed my Machine Learning web app using Flask!

I trained a Logistic Regression model on the Framingham dataset to predict 10-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk based on patient health data.

Then, I wrapped it with a Flask application and created a web interface to allow anyone to input patient data and get instant predictions.

🛠️ Tools used:

Python

Pandas, Scikit-learn

Joblib

Flask

HTML (Jinja2 templates)

💡 What I learned:

How to move from notebook → full script → web app

How to handle missing data and prepare ML features

How to deploy an ML model with a clean user interface
